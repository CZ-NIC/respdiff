# Overview
This set of benchmarks for DNS resolvers. We develop them for [Knot Resolver](https://www.knot-resolver.cz/) but they will work with any DNS server.

## Benchmarks
* [Response differences](https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/knot/resolver-benchmarking/tree/master/response_differences/respdiff) aka "respdiff" - Tool to compare answers from different resolvers.
* [Cache usage benchmark](https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/knot/resolver-benchmarking/tree/master/cache_usage_benchmark) - Benchmark to quantify resolution speed depending on the cache usage. Please note that cache usage benchmark is unmaintained at the moment!
